# BikeSalesDashboard
Using raw data in excel, built an interactive dashboard of the bike sales and how it is being affected by various factors.
Key Features:

Data Cleaning: The raw data undergoes thorough cleaning processes to ensure accuracy and consistency. This step involves removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats.

Pivot Table Creation: A series of pivot tables are built based on the cleaned data. Pivot tables provide a flexible and dynamic way to summarize and analyze large datasets, allowing for quick exploration and extraction of key information.

Data Visualization: The pivot tables serve as the foundation for visualizing the data. Clustered bar chart and line charts are utilized to present the data in a visually appealing and understandable manner. The visualization helps identify trends, patterns, and outliers within the dataset.

Interactive Analysis: The Excel project goes beyond static visualizations by incorporating interactive elements. Users can interact with the charts and pivot tables to dynamically filter and drill down into specific subsets of the data, enabling deeper exploration and analysis.
